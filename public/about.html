    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Joe, I am an electrician of 14+ years. I've always wanted
      to learn how to code. While looking online for where to start, I
      discovered web development and began to get my feet wet. From the moment I
      began I was hooked. I was also blown away to find out that away that
      someone could be self taught and actually make the transition into tech.
      Initially this was all news to me, I was always under the impression that
      you would need a college degree to do anything tech related. At that
      moment I have made it my mission to become a web developer.
